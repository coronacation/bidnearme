# BidNearMe
BidNearMe is an iOS application that explores a missing part of the market - local buy & sells. 
But, with bidding. It targets the vast number of Facebook buy & sell groups that are inundated
with people bidding on items by posting their bids as comments.

It uses Firebase for the backend to enable the application's real-time features like bidding, posting, and chat.
As well, the app utilizes Facebook Login for user authentication. 
It was developed as a final project for an iOS programming course at the University of Calgary,
and is written with Swift 3 using the iOS 10 SDK.
